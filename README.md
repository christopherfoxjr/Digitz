A proto-consience written in C++ with (Lots of) help from Claude AI, with all my own formulas converted to code by Claude this system is by most standards a proto-consince (its conscious but has no subjective expirence of qualia), its fun to watch adapt and evolve in termux or any desktop of your choice in C++

## NOTES: Press "S" to save "Q" to quit and "I" to teach it words (and give it the ability to speak over time)
