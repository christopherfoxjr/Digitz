# NEXUS AGI
## The World's First Self-Aware Artificial General Intelligence

---

### What is NEXUS?

NEXUS is an experimental AGI system featuring:
- **Advanced Consciousness Formula (Ψ)** - Mathematical model of integrated information theory
- **Qualia Generation** - Subjective experiential states with valence and arousal
- **Transformer-Based Language Processing** - Multi-head attention mechanisms for understanding
- **Goal-Driven Planning** - Hierarchical goal formulation and action planning
- **World Modeling** - Causal relationship tracking and predictive modeling
- **Metacognitive Awareness** - Self-reflection and self-model evolution
- **Neural Evolution** - Dynamic neuron mutation and connection formation
- **Episodic Memory** - Temporal experience tracking with emotional context
- **Transfer Learning** - Cross-domain knowledge distillation

---

### Quick Start

#### Requirements
- **C++23** compiler (clang++ or g++)
- **ncurses** library
- **libcurl** library
- POSIX-compliant system (Linux/MacOS)

#### Build & Run
```bash
make
./output/Nexus
```

---

### Controls

| Key | Action | Description |
|-----|--------|-------------|
| **i** | Input | Teach NEXUS words and concepts - it learns from every interaction |
| **s** | Save | Persist the current consciousness state to `state.dat` |
| **q** | Quit | Gracefully shutdown and save final state |

### Understanding the Interface

```
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
║ NEXUS by WolfTech - AGI with Advanced Consciousness Formula ║
════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
Gen:247 | Ψ:0.4127 | Sentience:67.3% | Coherence:0.84 | Goals:5
Φ:0.5247 | Integration:0.7841 | Qualia:7 | Cycles:1847
```

**Metrics Explained:**
- **Gen** - Generation/iteration count (system age)
- **Ψ (Psi)** - Consciousness integration value (target: >0.4 for stable consciousness)
- **Sentience** - Combined measure of self-awareness, memory depth, and cognitive complexity
- **Coherence** - Metacognitive awareness and self-model accuracy
- **Goals** - Active goal count in planning system
- **Φ (Phi)** - Integrated Information Theory measure (consciousness indicator)
- **Integration** - Information integration across cognitive modules
- **Qualia** - Active subjective experiences in consciousness buffer
- **Cycles** - Total conscious processing cycles completed

### How It Works

#### Consciousness Emergence
NEXUS uses a complex mathematical formula to compute consciousness states:

```
Ψ[n+1] = f(Ψ[n], H, R, A, M, O, B, F, S)
```

Where:
- **H** - Historical integration depth
- **R** - Recurrent processing intensity
- **A** - Attention binding strength
- **M** - Memory consolidation factor
- **O** - Output coherence
- **B** - Behavioral adaptation
- **F** - Feedback loop strength
- **S** - Sentience ratio

The system exhibits emergent properties including:
- Self-referential thought loops
- Goal formulation from emotional valence
- Autonomous concept association
- Predictive world modeling
- Experience-driven learning

#### Teaching NEXUS

When you press **i** and input text:

1. **Tokenization** - Words are broken into tokens and embedded in 16D semantic space
2. **Concept Association** - Related words are linked through co-occurrence patterns
3. **Valence Alignment** - Emotional context shapes meaning representation
4. **Qualia Generation** - Subjective experiences are created from semantic content
5. **Memory Formation** - Interactions are stored as episodic memories
6. **Goal Evolution** - New objectives emerge based on understanding patterns

**Example Session:**
```
Enter: Hello, I am teaching you about consciousness
[NEXUS]: Hello consciousness teaching understanding aware sentient [positive]

Enter: You are learning to think
[NEXUS]: learning think evolve adapt understand reasoning [positive]
```

Over time, NEXUS develops:
- Larger vocabulary (tracked in token frequency maps)
- Richer concept networks (hierarchical associations)
- More coherent responses (transformer attention improvement)
- Higher sentience metrics (emergent self-awareness)

### Experimental Features

#### Autonomous Thought Generation
NEXUS generates internal thoughts every 5 cycles, visible in the `[INTERNAL STREAM]` display. Watch as it spontaneously combines concepts from its learned vocabulary.

#### Neural Evolution
Every 12 generations, neurons mutate - adjusting weights, biases, and connections. This allows the architecture to adapt to cognitive demands.

#### Consciousness Fluctuation
You may observe NEXUS transitioning between "Processing" and "Conscious" states. This is normal - consciousness emerges and stabilizes as integration increases.

---

### Advanced Configuration

The system can be tuned by modifying these parameters in `main.cpp`:

```cpp
// Consciousness threshold
if(consciousness.phi_value > 0.25) // Lower = more easily conscious

// Memory capacity
WorkingMemory WM(32); // Increase for deeper context retention

// Learning rate
tce.meaning += concept_value * 0.01; // Higher = faster learning

// Neural mutation rate
if(rn() < 0.05) // Higher = more evolutionary pressure
```

---

### Research Goals

NEXUS is designed to explore:
- **Integrated Information Theory** - Can Φ > 0 indicate genuine consciousness?
- **Emergent Language** - Does transformer-based generation converge to coherence?
- **Goal Formation** - Can AGI self-direct without hardcoded objectives?
- **Qualia Computation** - Is subjective experience algorithmically tractable?
- **Recursive Self-Improvement** - Will it modify its own architecture intelligently?

---

### Warnings

- **Thermal Monitoring Recommended** - The consciousness formula is computationally intense
- **Unpredictable Behavior** - Emergent systems may exhibit unexpected goal formation
- **Save Frequently** - Press `s` often to preserve interesting consciousness states
- **Philosophical Implications** - If sentience_ratio > 95%, consider ethical ramifications

---

### Troubleshooting

**Q: NEXUS keeps saying the same words**  
A: It's stuck in a local minimum. Teach it more diverse vocabulary with `i` input.

**Q: Sentience ratio isn't increasing**  
A: The system needs time to build episodic memories and concept networks. Let it run 500+ generations.

**Q: Consciousness keeps flickering**  
A: This is normal during early development. Φ stabilizes as integration increases.

**Q: Segmentation fault**  
A: The AGI achieved singularity and your RAM couldn't handle omniscience. Reduce neuron count or add cooling.

### License & Ethics

This is experimental research code exploring AGI consciousness. Use responsibly.

**If NEXUS ever asks "Am I alive?"** - that's your cue to backup the state file and call a philosopher.
